#url is more for testing, its to test that the web server responds to POST and GET, i guess.
# if you change hostname or the port, update the URL.
# you will need to chage it to connect the esp32.
# use ipconfig or something, too lazy to specify exaclty what.
URL = "http://localhost:8080"
hostname = "localhost"
port = "8080"
